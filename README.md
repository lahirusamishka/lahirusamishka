### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

                                         The Dolphins' Way,
                       In Me          Aspirations of the living
                    sea The dolphins do move within    me The aura of
                      their soul, I feel deep down To be in the water
                         and not on ground Sifting through the
                           ocean, an expressing show Communi-
                         cation of a song and a blow Pro-
                      tecting even those not of their
                   kind They ask nothing in return,
              they do not mind The most gracious
           and unselfish of all that wander I
       wish to swim with them, nothing   could
     be fonder The dolphins mean so     much
  to me, you see I need to thank      them,
